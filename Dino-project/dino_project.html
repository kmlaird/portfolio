      <h2>What are dinosaurs?</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that dominated the land for over 140
        million years. They are defined by their anatomy, with straight backs
        perpendicular to their bodies. Their legs were also positioned under
        their bodies (rather than on either side like lizards), which better
        supported their weight.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike what many movies portray, not all extinct reptiles from that time
        period are dinosaurs. Non-dinosaur reptiles include pterosaurs (extinct
        flying reptiles) and marine reptiles.
        <br />
        <br />
        Main characteristics of dinosaurs include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They had an upright stance, with legs perpendicular to their body.
        </li>
        <li>They laid eggs.</li>
        <li>They lived on land (with a few exceptions).</li>
        <li>Their skull had a hole between the eye socket and nostril.</li>
        <li>
          Dinosaurs also had two holes behind the eye socket. Large, strong jaw
          muscles went through the holes to attach directly to the top of the
          skull.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Climate: </strong>Relatively hot and dry, covered in large

        <p>
          <strong>Climate: </strong>Temperatures fell slightly. Rainfall
          increased as a result of large seas appearing between land masses as
